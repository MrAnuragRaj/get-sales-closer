## Database

### Confirmed Tables (referenced + verified across codebase)
`profiles`, `leads`, `interactions`, `appointments`, `voice_usage`, `lead_timeline_events`,
`lead_actions`, `org_members`, `org_services`, `org_settings`, `beta_interest`,
`billing_intents`, `payment_attempts`, `knowledge_base`, `security_events`,
`execution_tasks`, `voice_calls`, `notifications`, `campaigns`, `campaign_leads`,
`org_channels`, `org_channel_provision_requests`, `conversation_state`, `active_org_prompts`,
`decision_plans`, `organizations`

### Tables Confirmed & Seeded (Session 5)
| Table | Status |
|---|---|
| `org_billing_profiles` | ✅ Created + RLS applied |
| `decision_plans` | ✅ Confirmed exists, indexes applied |
| `org_prompts` | ✅ Seeded 33 rows (11 orgs × 3 channels); `active_org_prompts` view reads it |
| `organizations.ai_credits_balance` | ✅ Set to 999999 for admin org |

### ❌ Removed from Schema (were dead references)
| Reference | Removed From | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| `user_subscriptions` | `login.html` | Table doesn't exist; replaced with `org_members → org_services` |
| `entitlements` | `pricing.html` | Table doesn't exist; replaced with `org_members → org_services` |
| `properties(nickname)` | `supabase-logic.js` | Table doesn't exist; was legacy real-estate prototype code |
| `leads.conversation_history` | `supabase-logic.js` | Column doesn't exist; conversations live in `interactions` table |

### Storage Buckets
- `logos` — Company branding images
- `documents` — Knowledge Brain PDFs

### Key RPCs
`is_lead_terminal`, `consume_tokens_v1`, `grant_tokens_core_v1`,
`settle_voice_call_tokens_v2`, `resolve_inbound_org_channel_v1`,
`apply_lead_halt_and_cancel`, `cancel_pending_retries_channel`, `approve_bank_transfer`,
`export_lead_timeline`, `get_active_entitlements`, `create_checkout_intent`,
`record_webhook_and_process_razorpay`, `resolve_billing_recipients_v1`,
`is_kill_switch_enabled_v1`, `is_org_member`, `is_org_admin_or_owner`,
`enforce_rate_limit_v1`, `claim_pending_notifications`, `claim_campaign_leads`,
`fetch_due_tasks`, `execution_policy_v1`

## Architecture Patterns

### Auth Guard
All protected pages use `auth.js` → `requireAuth()`.
- Requires `<script src="auth.js">` loaded before page script
- Requires `<div id="auth-loader">` (loading screen, visible by default)
- Requires `<div id="page-content">` (hidden by default, shown on auth success)
- Callback pattern: `requireAuth({ onAuthenticated: (profile, user, sb) => { /* page logic */ } })`
- **Exception**: `pricing.html` and `payment.html` use inline auth-loader pattern (no auth.js); both redirect to `login.html` on no session

### Entitlement Check Pattern (all module pages)
```js
const { data: membership } = await sb.from('org_members').select('org_id').eq('user_id', user.id).limit(1).single();
const { data: service } = await sb.from('org_services').select('status').eq('org_id', membership.org_id).eq('service_key', serviceKey).maybeSingle();
if (service?.status !== 'active') window.location.href = 'billing.html?lock={key}';
```

### Service Entitlement Keys
| Module | service_key |
|---|---|
| Instant Sentinel | `sentinel` |
| Voice Liaison | `voice` |
| Knowledge Brain | `brain` |
| App Architect | `architect` |

### Token System
- Voice: 5 tokens pre-debit, settled via `settle_voice_call_tokens_v2`
- SMS: 1 token per message
- Email: 1 token per message
- Refund on failure via `grant_tokens_core_v1`

### Billing Lock Guard (voice execution)
`executor_voice` and `voice_turn` both query `org_billing_profiles.billing_lock_status`.
- No row for org = `"none"` = not locked (safe default)
- Query ERROR = fail-closed (blocks all voice spend) — **table must exist**
- Lock values: `none`, `soft_lock`, `hard_lock`, `manual_lock`

### Pricing Modules
- Base: Instant Sentinel ($49), Voice Liaison ($149)
- Add-ons: Knowledge Brain, App Architect
- Rules: Knowledge Brain & App Architect require Sentinel or Voice as base
- Elite bundle: Voice + Brain + Architect = $349/mo
- Pricing logic lives in: `pricing.html` (new users) and `billing.html` (existing users)

## 🧪 END-TO-END TEST PLAN (Next Session)

**Status: NOT STARTED — must be done before launch**

### 1. Auth Flow
- [ ] `index.html` → Deploy My Closer → lands on `pricing.html` (not login)
- [ ] `pricing.html` visited while logged out → redirects to `login.html`
- [ ] New account signup → lands on `pricing.html`
- [ ] Existing account with active services → lands on `dashboard.html`

### 2. Pricing → Payment
- [ ] Select modules on `pricing.html` → Deploy → redirects to `payment.html?intent_id=...`
- [ ] Razorpay or Bank Transfer → `billing_intents` row created in Supabase

### 3. Dashboard
- [ ] Live Traffic panel loads
- [ ] System Monitor / war-room feed shows recent interactions
- [ ] Revenue Doctor Priority Action card shows real data
- [ ] Sidebar module links correct (locked ones show lock icon)

### 4. Module Pages
- [ ] **Sentinel** — lead list loads; "View Full CRM Profile" modal opens with data
- [ ] **Voice Liaison** — call log loads; Replay button appears on rows with recordings
- [ ] **Knowledge Brain** — PDF upload works; text rule saves; Stored Knowledge list shows entries; delete works
- [ ] **App Architect** — appointment list loads

### 5. Admin Panel
- [ ] Only `anurag@yogmayaindustries.com` can access (others redirect to dashboard)
- [ ] Bank Transfers table loads
- [ ] Active Entitlements table loads
- [ ] AI Prompt Editor — prompts show per org×channel; inline edit → save works
- [ ] Rate Limit panel — org rows with task counts + billing lock status

## Supabase Direct Access
Management API PAT stored in Claude memory (`supabase-access.md`). Run SQL via:
```bash
curl -s -X POST "https://api.supabase.com/v1/projects/klbwigcvrdfeeeeotehu/database/query" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {PAT}" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "SQL;"}'
```

## Completed Work Log

### Session 7 — 2026-03-03 (Admin Auth + Storage Upload Fix)

**admin.html — auth method replaced:**
- Switched from `onAuthStateChange(INITIAL_SESSION)` to `getUser()` IIFE
- Root cause of frozen spinner: `onAuthStateChange` fires asynchronously and can miss the INITIAL_SESSION event in certain redirect/timing scenarios; `getUser()` validates JWT directly against Supabase API — never hangs, no event race conditions
- DB confirmed correct: `is_admin = true` for `anurag@yogmayaindustries.com` (id `4c4ae696-de66-4b32-833c-b656454437d6`)

**Storage — documents INSERT policy added (directly via SQL):**
- Root cause of Knowledge Brain "upload failed: new row violates row-level security policy": storage INSERT policy was never added for the `documents` bucket (only SELECT + DELETE existed)
- Added: `CREATE POLICY "Users can upload own documents" ON storage.objects FOR INSERT TO authenticated WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'documents' AND (auth.uid())::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1])`
- Note: The "Upload Failed:" error message prefix comes from the storage upload step (not the DB insert step)

**billing.html — yearly toggle added (Session 6 work also included):**
- Monthly/Yearly toggle with 20% off yearly (×0.8 multiplier)
- Explicit dollar savings display; removed misleading "2 months free" note

---

### Session 6 — 2026-03-03 (Bug Fixes + Supabase Access)

**billing.html price display fix:**
- `calculate()` now handles Brain (B) or Architect (A) selected without a base service (S or L)
- Previously returned `base = 0` → showed `--`; now implies Sentinel ($49) as minimum required base
- Added `#baseImpliedHint` yellow notice: "Instant Sentinel ($49 base) will be included — required for this module"

**login.html admin redirect fix:**
- Admin users now redirect to `admin.html` (was incorrectly redirecting to `dashboard.html`)
- Root cause of redirect-to-pricing: Session 1 SQL used `WHERE email = ...` but `profiles` has no `email` column → UPDATE matched 0 rows → `is_admin` was never set

**Database fix (via Management API):**
- Ran: `UPDATE profiles SET is_admin = true WHERE id = (SELECT id FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'anurag@yogmayaindustries.com')`
- Verified: `is_admin = true` confirmed for user id `4c4ae696-de66-4b32-833c-b656454437d6`

**Supabase direct access:**
- Management API PAT obtained and stored in Claude memory (not in git)
- Claude can now run arbitrary SQL without user intervention

---

### Session 4 — 2026-02-26 (Schema Audit + Full Wiring Fixes)

**Security:**
- `dashboard.html`: Fixed XSS in `subscribeToInteractions()` — `payload.new.content` now set via `textContent` not `innerHTML`

**Auth & Flow:**
- `login.html`: Replaced broken `user_subscriptions` check (table doesn't exist) with real `org_members → org_services` entitlement pattern
- `pricing.html`: Replaced broken `entitlements` table check with `org_members → org_services`; fixed dead `overview.html` redirect → `dashboard.html`; added page-load auth guard with loader overlay
- `payment.html`: Added auth-loader overlay; content hidden until session + intent confirmed; fixed dead `overview.html` redirect → `dashboard.html`

**UI Completeness:**
- `dashboard.html`: Added `loadLiveTraffic()` — fetches top-15 org leads by last activity, renders status badge + risk dot + timeAgo in Live Traffic panel
- `dashboard.html`: Added `loadRecentInteractions()` — pre-populates System Monitor / war-room-feed with last 10 org interactions on load
- `Voice Liaison.html`: Added Replay button — checks `metadata.recording_url`; opens audio player modal; dismiss via × or backdrop

**Backend:**
- `webhook_inbound`: Extracts `recordingUrl` from VAPI `end-of-call-report` payload; stores as `interactions.metadata.recording_url`

**Dead Code / Schema Cleanup:**
- `supabase-logic.js`: Removed `properties(nickname)` join (table doesn't exist); removed `lead.conversation_history` reference (field doesn't exist); replaced with real columns `lead.source` + `lead.last_interaction_at`

**Migrations:**
- Created `supabase/migrations/20260226_org_billing_profiles.sql` — ⚠️ MUST be run manually in Supabase

---

### Session 3 — 2026-02-26

- `sentinel.html`: "View Full CRM Profile" modal — full lead fields + `lead_timeline_events` timeline
- `Knowledge Brain.html`: "Stored Knowledge" read view — lists all entries, type badge, preview, delete
- `dashboard.html`: `runRevenueDiagnosis()` wired to real `interactions` data; Priority Action card updates live
- `dashboard.html`: `subscribeToInteractions()` — real-time feed via Supabase Realtime
- `dashboard.js`: Deleted (confirmed dead code)

---

### Session 1 — 2026-02-26

- `admin.html`: `is_admin` check added; non-admins redirect to dashboard
- `sentinel.html`, `Voice Liaison.html`, `App Architect.html`, `Knowledge Brain.html`: auth guards + entitlement locks added
- `overview.html`: Deleted (old prototype)
- SQL: `profiles.is_admin` column added; `anurag@yogmayaindustries.com` set as admin

---

## SQL Migrations

### Applied
```sql
-- is_admin column (Session 1)
ALTER TABLE profiles ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS is_admin BOOLEAN DEFAULT false;
UPDATE profiles SET is_admin = true WHERE email = 'anurag@yogmayaindustries.com';
```

### Session 5 — Applied (2026-02-27)
- `org_billing_profiles` table created with RLS
- `org_prompts` seeded: 11 orgs × 3 channels (sms/email/voice), safety_level='moderate'
- `organizations.ai_credits_balance = 999999` for admin org
- `decision_plans` indexes confirmed
- Admin RLS policies added: `org_prompts` (select+update), `execution_tasks` (select), `org_billing_profiles` (select), `org_settings` (select+update)

---

## Known Non-Issues (Memory Corrections)

- `knowledge_brain` Edge Function has full OpenAI integration with GPT-4o/GPT-4o-mini model selection — NOT a stub
- `admin.html` credentials are real — NOT placeholders
- `success.html` billing_intents polling is active and working
- `dashboard.html` sidebar already queries `org_services` live — entitlements were already done in Session 1
- `org_billing_profiles` query returning null (no row) is safe — only a query ERROR triggers fail-closed
